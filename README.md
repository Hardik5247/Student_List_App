This is a Student List app which shows List of Students with their details in a Recycler View.
This app makes use of Navigation, Jetpack and MVVM architecture.
Pretty much everything used to make this app was new to me like Firebase Auth, Realtime Database, MVVM, Jetpack, Recycler View.
None of these things was used by me in coding of my SOC project.
